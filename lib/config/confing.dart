/*
Server IP Configuration, please set according to your server settings.

Format : 
  const String SERVER_IP = 'ws://<your_server_ip>:<port>/ws/transcribe';
  Example:
  const String SERVER_IP = 'ws://168.132.16.36:8000/ws/transcribe';

When testing, be sure that your server is reachable from your device (whichever is Phone or Vuzix or other devices) network.
So you need to be in the same network (e.g. same WiFi/Hotspot) of your server.
