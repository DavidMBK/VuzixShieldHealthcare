## üìã Prerequisites

### System Requirements

| Component | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| Flutter SDK | 3.32.6 (Stable) |
| Dart SDK | 3.8.1 |
| Platform | Android (Vuzix smart glasses or Android phone) |

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Flutter

#### Recommended: Video Tutorial
Follow this comprehensive Flutter installation guide: [Flutter Installation Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mMeQhLGD-og)

#### Alternative: Official Documentation
Visit [Flutter's official installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) for your operating system.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Verify Flutter Installation

flutter --version


**Expected output:**

Flutter 3.32.6 - channel stable - https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
Framework - revision 077b4a4ce1 (4 months ago) - 2025-07-08 13:31:08 -0700
Engine - revision 72f2b18bb0 (4 months ago) - 2025-07-08 10:33:53 -0700

**Note**: Minor version differences are acceptable (e.g., 3.x.x), but ensure you're on a stable channel.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <project-directory>


### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies

flutter pub get

**Installation time**: Typically 1-3 minutes depending on network speed.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### üî¥ CRITICAL: Server IP Configuration

This is the **most important step**. The application will not work without proper server configuration.

#### Step 1: Locate Configuration File
Find the server IP configuration in your project (typically in `lib/config/config.dart` or at the top of your main Dart files).

#### Step 2: Get Your Server IP Address

**On Windows (Server machine):**

ipconfig

Look for `IPv4 Address` under your active network adapter (e.g., `128.162.12.74`) (WIFI, not Ethernet)

**On macOS/Linux (Server machine):**

ip addr show

#### Step 3: Update Server IP

Edit the configuration file and replace the IP address:

const String SERVER_IP = 'ws://128.162.12.74:8000/ws/transcribe';

**Replace `128.162.12.74` with your actual server IP address of the server (REMEMBER SAME WIFI).**

### Network Requirements

üî¥ **CRITICAL NETWORK SETUP**:

1. **Same Network Requirement**: Both the Flutter device (Vuzix/phone) and the server **MUST** be on the same network
2. **Supported Configurations**:
   - Both connected to the same WiFi network
   - Server creates a hotspot, device connects to it
   - Device creates a hotspot, server connects to it
3. **Test Connectivity**: Ping the server from your device before running the app

**Testing Server Reachability:**

#### On Android device (using Termux or similar):

ping <server_ip>

#### Example: 

ping 128.162.12.74

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### ‚ùå WebSocket Connection Failed

**Symptoms:**
- "Disconnected" status shown
- No transcription appearing
- Console shows connection errors

**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Verify server is running (`python main.py` on server)
2. ‚úÖ Check `SERVER_IP` matches your server's actual IP address
3. ‚úÖ Ensure both devices are on **the same network**
4. ‚úÖ Ping server from device to test connectivity
5. ‚úÖ Check firewall settings on server machine
6. ‚úÖ Verify port 8000 is not blocked

**Test Server Reachability:**

On device terminal
ping <your_server_ip>

---

#### ‚ùå Microphone Not Working

**Symptoms:**
- No audio recording
- VAD not detecting speech
- Permission errors

**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Grant microphone permission in app settings
2. ‚úÖ Test on **physical device with working microphone** (emulators not supported)
3. ‚úÖ Check device microphone works in other apps
4. ‚úÖ Restart application after granting permissions

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: This application requires a physical device with a functional microphone. Virtual emulators and simulators have shown unreliable microphone support and are not recommended.

---

#### ‚ùå VAD Model Not Loading

**Symptoms:**
- Error: "Failed to load VAD model"
- App crashes on startup

**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Ensure `vad` package is properly installed (`flutter pub get`)
2. ‚úÖ Check `assets/packages/vad/assets/silero_vad.onnx` exists
3. ‚úÖ Verify `pubspec.yaml` includes VAD assets
4. ‚úÖ Run `flutter clean && flutter pub get`

---

#### ‚ùå Display Issues on Vuzix

**Symptoms:**
- UI elements cut off
- Incorrect orientation
- Text too small/large

**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Ensure landscape orientation is locked in code
2. ‚úÖ Verify fullscreen mode is enabled
3. ‚úÖ Check Vuzix display settings
4. ‚úÖ Adjust font sizes in `app_styles.dart` if needed

---

#### ‚ùå Flutter Pub Get Fails

**Symptoms:**
- Dependency resolution errors
- Package conflicts

**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Update Flutter SDK: `flutter upgrade`
2. ‚úÖ Clean project: `flutter clean`
3. ‚úÖ Remove pubspec.lock and retry: `rm pubspec.lock && flutter pub get`
4. ‚úÖ Check internet connection

---

#### ‚ùå App Crashes on Startup

**Solutions:**
1. ‚úÖ Check device meets minimum requirements (Android 5.0+)
2. ‚úÖ Review error logs: `flutter logs`
3. ‚úÖ Rebuild app: `flutter clean && flutter run`
4. ‚úÖ Ensure all dependencies are compatible

---

### Testing Recommendations

#### ‚úÖ Recommended Testing Environment
- **Physical Android device** with working microphone
- **Vuzix smart glasses** (production environment)
- **Same WiFi network** as server
- **Quiet environment** for accurate voice detection

#### ‚ùå Not Recommended
